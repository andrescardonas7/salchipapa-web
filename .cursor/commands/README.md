# Commands (`.cursor/commands`)

This folder contains **slash commands** and helpers for AI workflows. In Cursor, each `.md` file is exposed as a slash command (e.g. `plan.md` → `/plan`).

---

## What lives here

- **`*.md`** — Command definitions: frontmatter (`description`) and body (what the command does, when to use it, examples).
- **`*.ps1`** and other scripts — Utilities (e.g. `switch-theme.ps1`); not slash commands by themselves.

Meta / docs (not meant as slash commands): `README.md`, `README-theme-switcher.md`, `ANALISIS-COMANDOS-CURSOR.md`.

## How to use

- In Cursor: type `/` and pick a command; the chosen `.md` is used as the prompt/context.
- Commands often refer to agents in `agents/` (e.g. planner, tdd-guide, code-reviewer). When using the hub, agents live under `.cursor/agents/`.
