# Check

Perform comprehensive code quality and security checks.

## Primary Task:

Run `pnpm run check` (or project-specific check command) and resolve any resulting errors.

## Important:

- DO NOT commit any code during this process
- DO NOT change version numbers
- Focus only on fixing issues identified by checks

## Common Checks Include:

1. **Linting**: Code style and syntax errors
2. **Type Checking**: TypeScript/Flow type errors
3. **Unit Tests**: Failing test cases
4. **Security Scan**: Vulnerability detection
5. **Code Formatting**: Style consistency
6. **Build Verification**: Compilation errors

## Process:

1. Run the check command
2. Analyze output for errors and warnings
3. Fix issues in priority order:
   - Build-breaking errors first
   - Test failures
   - Linting errors
   - Warnings
4. Re-run checks after each fix
5. Continue until all checks pass

## For Different Project Types:

- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: `pnpm run check` or `yarn check`
- **Python**: `black`, `isort`, `flake8`, `mypy`
- **Rust**: `cargo check`, `cargo clippy`
- **Go**: `go vet`, `golint`
- **Swift**: `swift-format`, `swiftlint`

## Before You Start

1. Ensure your working tree is clean: `git status` should show no pending changes.
2. Pull the latest changes from `main` (or default branch).
3. Verify you are using the correct runtime/toolchain versions (Node, Python, Go, etc.).
4. Install dependencies with the project's package manager (e.g., `pnpm i`, `pip install -r requirements.txt`).
5. If necessary, stash or shelve unrelated changes before running checks.

## During Fixing

- Keep fixes minimal and scoped strictly to errors reported by the check command.
- Prefer small, incremental changes; rerun checks after each logical fix.
- If a warning cannot be resolved quickly, add a TODO comment referencing an issue number.
- Never bump library versions unless explicitly required by the team.

## After All Checks Pass

1. Create a single, clean commit containing only the fixes
