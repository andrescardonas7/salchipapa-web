# Agents (`.cursor/agents`)

This folder holds **agent personas** (system prompts) for different roles. Each file is one persona and is referenced by slash commands or used when a role-based behavior is needed.

---

## What lives here

- One Markdown file per agent (e.g. `architect.md`, `planner.md`).
- Frontmatter usually includes: `name`, `description`, `tools`, `model`.
- Body: role, process, principles, and examples.

## When to use

- **Slash commands** (e.g. `/plan`, `/tdd`, `/code-review`) reference these agents by name.
- Use when you want **consistent role-based behavior** across tools or sessions.
- They also document what “good” looks like for each role for humans.

---

## Paths

- In Cursor (hub): `.cursor/agents/<name>.md`.
- Some commands still point to `~/.claude/agents/`; when using the hub, agents are under `.cursor/agents/`.
