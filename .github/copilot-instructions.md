# Copilot Instructions

This workspace uses a shared “AI rules hub” stored in a central `.cursor/` source-of-truth.

## Core rules

- Follow repository rules in `.cursor/rules/RULE.md` when present.
- Prefer `pnpm` over npm/yarn.
- No secrets in code; validate external input; avoid unsafe shell execution.
- Keep files <300 lines and functions <50 lines.

## Where to look

- **Rules**: `.cursor/rules/` (exported from Cursor `.mdc` where needed)
- **Skills**: `.cursor/skills/`
- **Hooks**: `.cursor/hooks/`
- **Agents**: `.cursor/agents/`

If you are unsure which rule applies, ask clarifying questions.
